for rewrite
with list of all states,
for each possible sequences generate an id
map sequence to id
add score meaning the more a sequence is used the better
score is also based on number of files needed so the size of the sequence
score is how much is saved in number of files, so each time a new sequence is reused we add the size of the sequence (number of file saved)
for each sequence group instead of blocks because there are less to handle this way then we can map sequence id to block
